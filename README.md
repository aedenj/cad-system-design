# Computer Aided Dispatch System Design

Emergency service agencies are responsible for responding to urgent and life-threatening situations to protect public safety, health and property. Those responses require sharing critical data between citizens (reporting parties), call takers, dispatchers and first-responders in near real-time.

Computer Aided Dispatch provides an automated way for emergency service agencies to keep track of incidents, activities, information, tasks, messages and the status of deployed resources. By using a C.A.D. Command staff are able to see the big picture, while at the same time maintaining detailed records of plans and actions for future reference. Deployed resources are able to clearly communicate in realtime, while having much better situational awareness of surrounding events.
