# Computer Aided Dispatch System Design

Computer Aided Dispatch provides an automated way for emergency services agencies to keep track of incidents, activities, information, tasks, messages, and the status of deployed resources. Command staff are able to see the big picture, while at the same time maintaining detailed records of plans and actions for future reference. Deployed resources are able to clearly communicate in realtime, while having much better situational awareness of surrounding events.
